# Discord Cat Profile Picture Randomizer

This Node.js script automatically updates your Discord profile picture with random cat images every 60 seconds using the `discord.js-selfbot-v13` library and the `random-cat-img` package.

## Warning

Use of selfbots (automating user accounts) is against Discord's Terms of Service. This script is for educational purposes only. Using it may result in your account being banned or other actions taken by Discord.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Your Discord user token.

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install discord.js-selfbot-v13
npm install random-cat-img
npm install node-fetch
```

3. Open the script file (e.g., `test.js`) and replace `'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'` with your Discord user token.

## Running the Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the script with Node.js(linux, git bash):
